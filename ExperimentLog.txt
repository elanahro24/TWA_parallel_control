Experiment log for TWA

2024_09_11
-> Notes: when plotting data, plotting raw data pre transformation in 3 dimensions reveals expected motion
-> tracing 0.25mm radius circle with twas
    -> ellipsoid shape output, could be due to starting position, flexure rigidity, twa motor housing
-> tracing 10mm radius circle with macro actuators
    -> perfect circle as expected

2024_09_10
-> Notes: both experiments showed diagonal motion from the vicra data
-> experiment tracing a circle 2mm in radius and using redundancy resolution to resolve position
	-> vicra data: twa_0910.tsv 
	-> did not save file scope data
-> experiment tracing a circle 1mm in radius and using inv kin only with TWA
	-> vicra data: twa_0910_twa.tsv
	-> file scope data: data0910_1.mat

2024_09_09
-> Go to position [10,-10] using redundnacy resolution
	-> vicra data: twa_0909.tsv
	-> file scope data: data0909.mat
