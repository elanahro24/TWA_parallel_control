# TWA_parallel_control

This is the control code for the TWA parallel robot. It is intended to be run on the with matlab 2010a 32bit (the only version with xPC). The Big Snake control box is used for motor control and the drivers for the target machine IO cards are not compatible with newer versions of Matlab.

Be sure to copy the ServoToGo folder into the C:/ of the host machine in order for simulink to recognize those blocks.
